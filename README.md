# TDA-ANALYSIS on signal dataset
Here, we are taking the periodic and non-periodic signals for analysing the Topology. 
The first step in analysing the topology of time series is to construct a time delay embedding or Takens embedding, named after Floris Takens who pioneered its use in the study of dynamical systems. A time delay embedding can be thought of as sliding a "window" of fixed size over a signal, with each window represented as a point in a (possibly) higher-dimensional space.
